This repository holds my solutions for Dave Thomas' Code Katas:
http://codekata.pragprog.com/2007/01/code_kata_backg.html

The layout of the repository is as such:
root
-- <kata #>
---- <solution #>
------ lib
------ test

Each test can be ran under the respective test directories, by running the following command:
ruby testall.rb
